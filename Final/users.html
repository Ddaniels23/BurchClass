        <h2>Noteable users</h2>
        <p>Argus cameras, particularly the iconic Argus C3—nicknamed The Brick—rose to prominence in the mid-20th century for their affordability, durability, and ease of use, making them popular with both amateurs and professionals. One of the most famous users was Tony Vaccaro, who used the C3 to capture striking images during World War II, documenting the war from a soldier’s perspective. Renowned photographer Duane Michals, known for his narrative and surrealist style, also began his photographic journey with an Argus camera, using it to explore creative storytelling through images. Even President Jimmy Carter was known to use an Argus C3 during his younger years, demonstrating the camera’s widespread appeal among everyday Americans. With its robust design and accessible price, the Argus C3 became a fixture in homes, schools, and even battlefields, leaving a lasting mark on photographic history.</p>
