        <h2>Argus cameras through the years</h2>
        <p>The evolution of Argus cameras reflects the company's commitment to accessible and affordable photography, beginning with the Argus A in 1936 — the first American-made, mass-produced 35mm camera. It was simple, compact, and inexpensive, helping to democratize photography. Argus followed this success with the legendary Argus C3 in 1939, known for its distinctive boxy design and durable build. The C3 remained in production for nearly 30 years, earning the nickname “The Brick” and becoming a favorite among amateur photographers and even some professionals. Over the years, Argus introduced several variants and successors, including the C4 and C44, which offered improved lenses and ergonomics, and later ventured into rangefinder and viewfinder models during the 1950s and '60s. As Japanese camera manufacturers began dominating the market with more advanced and compact models, Argus struggled to keep up technologically. The company eventually declined and ceased camera production in the late 1960s, but its impact on popular photography and mid-century design remains significant.</p>
