    <h2>A brief history of the XB</HTML></h2>
    <p>The Ford Falcon XB, produced by Ford Australia from 1973 to 1976, was the second iteration of the third-generation Falcon and is often celebrated as one of the most iconic Australian muscle cars. Building on the success of its predecessor, the XA, the XB featured more aggressive styling with a wider front grille, revised bumpers, and improved safety features. It was available in various body styles, including sedan, wagon, coupe, and utility, with engine options ranging from inline-sixes to powerful V8s. The XB also gained fame as the base for the "Pursuit Special" driven by Mel Gibson’s character in the Mad Max films, cementing its legacy in pop culture and automotive history.
